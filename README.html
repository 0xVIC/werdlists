<h1>Brief Introduction to <code>werdlists</code></h1>

<p>Text files consisting mostly of <a href="http://wordlist.aspell.net" title="SCOWL (Spell Checker Oriented Word Lists)">Wordlists</a> (whitespace-delimited/line-based
entries), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values" title="Wikipedia - Comma-seperated Values">CSV</a> (Comma Separated Values), Office Open XML (<a href="http://officeopenxml.com" title="Office Open XML - What is OOXML?">OOXML</a>) (a.k.a.
<a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-376.htm" title="Standard ECMA-376 (Office Open XML File Formats)">ECMA-376</a>) and similar data sets that are useful in manually crafting test
cases or developing an automated black-box fuzzer. In particular, the data 
contained within these mostly text files is intended for the purposes of 
programmatically testing security..</p>

<h2>Inspiration Taken from Similar Projects</h2>

<p>If you're already familiar with established repositories such as 
<a href="https://github.com/fuzzdb-project/fuzzdb/" title="The attack pattern dictionary">fuzzdb</a> and 
<a href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/" title="The security tester's companion">SecLists</a>, 
then <code>werdlists</code> is quite similar in mission as it's a centralized attack strings 
resource--just with its own unique style and organization, original hand-crafted contents, 
expanded concepts, etc.</p>

<h2>Description of the Repository Directory Hierarchy</h2>

<p>The <code>scripts</code> folder consists of shell scripts used for file system maintenance.
Folder names are outlined in the <code>INDEX.md</code> file at the root of the repository's
directory hierarchy.  All files in each folder are detailed in the local 
<code>index.md</code> file, but these lowercased index files describe file names as opposed
to directory contents.</p>

<h3>Naming Scheme, Syntax and Meaning Associated With File Extensions</h3>

<p>Most files have the <em>.txt</em> extension signifying the <code>text/plain</code> MIME type.
Some other file extensions are in use as well, including: <em>.csv</em>, <em>.xml</em>,
<em>.bin</em>, etc.  These are for Comma-Separated Values, Extended Markup Language
and Binary data, respectively.  The index in the root folder (<code>INDEX.md</code>),
as well as the indices in each data directory (<code>index.md</code>) are of course in
markdown format.</p>
