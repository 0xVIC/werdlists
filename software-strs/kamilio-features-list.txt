Robust and Performant SIP (RFC3261) Server flavours
Registrar server
Location server
Proxy server
SIP Application server
Redirect server
Flexibility
small footprint  suitable for embedded devices  the binary file is small size, functionality can be stripped/added via modules
plug&play module interface  ability to add new extensions, without touching the core, therefore assuring a great stability of core components
modular architecture  core, internal libraries and module interface to extend the servers functionality
impressive extension repository  overall more than 150 modules are included in the Kamailio source tree
SIP Routing Capabilities
stateless and transactional stateful SIP Proxy processing
serial and parallel forking
NAT traversal support for SIP and RTP traffic
load balancing with many distribution algorithms and failover support
flexible least cost routing
routing failover
replication for High Availability (HA)
Transport Layers
support for communication via UDP, TCP, TLS and SCTP
IPv4 and IPv6
transport layer gatewaying (IPv4 to IPv6, UDP to TLS, a.s.o.)
SCTP multi-homing and multi-streaming
WebSocket for WebRTC
Asynchronous Processing
asynchronous TCP handling
asynchronous SIP message processing
asynchronous inter-process message queues communication system
distributed message queue
Secure Communication

IP and DNS
support for SRV and NAPTR DNS lookups
SRV DNS failover
DNSsec support
ENUM support
internal DNS caching system  avoid DNS blocking

multi-homed and multi-domain support
topology hiding  hide IP addresses in SIP headers to protect your network architecture
Accounting
event based accounting
configurable accounting data details
multi-leg call accounting
storage to database, Radius or Diameter
prepaid engine
Configuration File
scripting language for configurations file. With a syntax similar to scripting languages, the configuration offers a powerful and flexible way to deploy custom SIP services.
pseudo-variables to access and manage parts of the SIP messages and attributes specific to users and server
transformations to modify existing pseudo-variables, accessing only the wanted parts of the information
over 1000 parameters, variables and functions exported to config file
runtime update framework  to avoid restarting the SIP server when needing to change the config parameters
External Interaction via
RPC control interface  via XMLRPC, JSONRPC, UDP or TCP
RabbitMQ and NSQ connectors
Rich Communication Services
SIP SIMPLE Presence Server (rich presence)
Presence User Agent
XCAP client capabilities
Embedded XCAP Server
Presence DialogInfo support  SLA/BLA
Instant Messaging
Embedded MSRP relay
Monitoring and Troubleshooting
SNMP  interface to Simple Network Management Protocol
config file step-by-step debugger
remote control via XMLRPC
internal statistics exported via RPC and SNMP
flexible debug and error message logging system  log custom messages including any header or pseudo-variable and parts of SIP message structure.
Extensibility APIs
Perl Programming Interface  embed your extensions written in Perl
Java SIP Servlet Application Interface  write Java SIP Servlets to extent your VoIP services and integrate with web services
Lua Programming Interface
