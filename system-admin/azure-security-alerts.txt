Obfuscated command line: This alert indicates that suspicious indicators of obfuscation were detected at the command line.
Multiple domain accounts queried: Attackers often query AD domain accounts while performing reconnaissance on users, domain admin accounts, domain controllers, and trust relationships between domains. This alert indicates that an unusual number of distinct domain accounts were queried within a short time period.
Possible local reconnaissance activity: This alert indicates that a combination of systeminfo commands associated with reconnaissance activity have been executed. While systeminfo.exe is a legitimate Windows tool, executing it twice in succession is rare.
