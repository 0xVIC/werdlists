Hi $TO$,

Thanks for your report. The request passed through one of our Tor exit
nodes. We do not allow email to be sent from our systems (port 25 is 
blocked), so the offender must have used a web based email account. 
You should direct your complaint to the mail server given in the email 
header, so they can close and/or track down the account.

Please let me know if I can be of further assistance.

I know this very unfortunate. Thanks for your understanding!
Yours sincerely,
