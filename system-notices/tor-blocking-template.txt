The attacker is using Tor. Tor will automatically select one of the
hundreds of available exit servers, that's why you see changing IPs. We
can block destination IPs for our small subset of Tor exit relays, but
that won't really help, the attacker will not even notice the change in 
exit relays available for him.

The only real solution here is to take care of Tor users on your side.
Please be aware that by blocking Tor, you also block all legitimate
users! Please lift the ban after the attack is over, or take care of Tor
users with other means (for example by only blocking access to sensitive
content, displaying extra CAPTCHAs for Tor users, etc).

You can detect Tor users via two mechanisms:

https://check.torproject.org/cgi-bin/TorBulkExitList.py
https://www.torproject.org/projects/tordnsel.html.en

Please only issue a temporary ban so legitimate Tor users are not 
affected for too long.

Hope this helps!
