RMKS/1.  This is a coordinated Deputy Under Secretary of the Navy Policy 
(DUSN(P)) Security, and Department of the Navy Chief Information Officer (DON 
CIO) message as part of the Department of the Navy's (DON) cyber/traditional 
security partnership for the protection of national security information and 
information systems.

2.  Purpose and Definitions.  The purpose of this ALNAV is to provide interim 
policy for acceptable use of personal portable electronic devices (PPEDs) in 
specific DON spaces based on device capability.  Terms used in this ALNAV are 
defined below:

    a.  A portable electronic device (PED) is defined in REF A as any non-
stationary electronic apparatus with singular or multiple capabilities of 
recording, storing, and/or transmitting data, voice, video, or photo images 
(e.g., cell phones, laptops, tablets, and wearable devices such as fitness 
bands and smart watches).

    b.  "Personal" in this message refers to PEDs personally owned by DON 
Sailors, Marines, civilians, and support contract personnel.

    c.  Commanding Officer (CO) in this message is a generic term used to 
identify a position of authority at any DON organization, base, station, 
unit, laboratory, installation, facility, center, activity, detachment, 
squadron, ship, battalion, regiment, etc.
   
    d.  Homeland connotes the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, 
United States possessions and territories, and surrounding territorial waters 
and airspace, per REF B.

    e.  Near Field Communication (NFC) connotes a short-range wireless 
communication system employing radio waves to enable a mobile device to 
interact with another device or card reader when within 10 cm (4 in) of each 
other.

3.  Scope and Applicability.  This ALNAV applies to all DON Sailors, Marines, 
civilians, and contract personnel regarding the use of PPEDs with specific 
capabilities in spaces where collateral classified information is processed, 
transmitted, stored, or discussed.  Non-DON personnel are prohibited from 
introducing PPEDs into DON spaces.  This ALNAV does not prevent COs from 
issuing stricter policy in accordance with the needs of their commands; 
authorize introduction of PPEDs into any DON spaces located outside the 
homeland or in Sensitive Compartmented Information Facilities (SCIFs) (see 
REF C); or apply to PEDs issued by the DON for official business.

4.  Discussion.  The proliferation of PPEDs in the form of wearable 
technology has increased dramatically since the introduction of wearable 
heart rate monitors in the 1980s. Today's portable electronic activity 
monitoring devices, (e.g., fitness, communication, and medical) offer a wide 
range of personal, professional, and health benefits.  However, these devices 
may pose security risks to DON information and information systems.  This 
message specifically identifies capabilities associated with PPEDs that are 
permitted in DON spaces where collateral classified information is processed, 
transmitted, stored, or discussed in order to allow PPED use while minimizing 
risk to DON information.  It also lays the groundwork for future DON wireless 
policies. 

5.  Action.  Effective immediately, all DON personnel using PPEDs in DON 
spaces where collateral classified information is processed, transmitted, 
stored, or discussed must comply with the requirements and responsibilities 
cited below:  

    a.  PPEDs are permitted:

        (1) If commercially obtained in the U.S. or through a U.S. military 
exchange and assigned a Federal Communication Commission (FCC) Identifier 
denoting compliance with the limits for a Class B digital device designated 
by the FCC, pursuant to Part 15 of the FCC Rules, per REF D.

        (2) If they contain only vendor-supplied software and receive only 
updates that do not add any features or capabilities prohibited in this 
message.
		
        (3) If they have any or all of the following:  Bluetooth, Global 
Positioning System (GPS) (RECEIVE-ONLY), accelerometer, altimeter, gyroscope, 
heart monitor, vibration, and/or NFC capabilities.

        (4) If they have password/pin protections enabled and have up-to-date 
anti-virus software protection installed, where those capabilities exist.

    b.  PPEDs are prohibited:
  
        (1) If they contain cellular and/or Wi-Fi transceivers, or other 
technologies not permitted in para 5.a. of this ALNAV.
   
        (2) If they have photographic, video capture/recording, microphone, 
and/or audio recording capabilities.

        (3) From being connected to any government information system either 
directly or indirectly using wired or wireless accessories (e.g., Bluetooth 
dongles and charging cables).

        (4) If they have removable media installed.

        (5) If they have the capability to perform radio frequency 
transmissions at greater than 100 milliwatts (mW) Equivalent Isotropically 
Radiated Power (EIRP).  Where feasible, EIRP shall be determined using FCC 
data.

    c.  Commanding Officers:

        (1) Ensure dissemination and enforcement of this policy, employing 
either technical monitoring per REFs E and F or through physical checks, spot 
checks, and/or physical searches.

        (2) Ensure compliance with the security incident reporting 
requirements of REFs B, G, H and I.  DON personnel who knowingly and 
willfully violate the requirements in this message are subject to preliminary 
inquiry and incident reporting in the Joint Personnel Adjudication System, 
potential loss of information system access, and possible punitive or 
administrative action.  
   
        (3) May grant interim approval for medically related PPEDs when the 
capabilities they possess are prohibited by this message.  In those 
instances, the Navy or USMC Authorizing Official must be notified within 30 
days of device make/model, the capability presenting risk, and the proposed 
mitigation. 

    d.  DON personnel:

        (1) Ensure PPEDs meet the criteria in para 5.a, prior to introducing 
them into areas where collateral classified information is processed, 
transmitted, stored, or discussed. 

        (2) Ensure the CO has not levied additional restrictions or 
prohibitions prior to introducing PPEDS in DON spaces where collateral 
classified information is processed, transmitted, stored, or discussed.

        (3) Obtain approval, per para 5.c(3) of this ALNAV, for any medically 
related PPEDs prior to introduction into areas where collateral classified 
information is processed, transmitted, stored, or discussed.

6.  This ALNAV remains in effect until incorporated in future DON wireless 
policy and REF G for safeguarding and reporting requirements.
