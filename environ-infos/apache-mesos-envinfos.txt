MESOS_FRAMEWORK_ID: FrameworkID of the scheduler needed as part of the SUBSCRIBE call.
MESOS_EXECUTOR_ID: ExecutorID of the executor needed as part of the SUBSCRIBE call.
MESOS_DIRECTORY: Path to the working directory for the executor on the host filesystem (deprecated).
MESOS_SANDBOX: Path to the mapped sandbox inside of the container (determined by the agent flag sandbox_directory) for either mesos container with image or docker container. For the case of command task without image specified, it is the path to the sandbox on the host filesystem, which is identical to MESOS_DIRECTORY. MESOS_DIRECTORY is always the sandbox on the host filesystem.
MESOS_AGENT_ENDPOINT: Agent endpoint (i.e., ip:port to be used by the executor to connect to the agent).
MESOS_CHECKPOINT: If set to true, denotes that framework has checkpointing enabled.
MESOS_EXECUTOR_SHUTDOWN_GRACE_PERIOD: Amount of time the agent would wait for an executor to shut down (e.g., 60secs, 3mins etc.) after sending a SHUTDOWN event.
MESOS_EXECUTOR_AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN: The token the executor should use to authenticate with the agent. When executor authentication is enabled, the agent generates a JSON web token (JWT) that the executor can use to authenticate with the agents default JWT authenticator.
MESOS_RECOVERY_TIMEOUT: The total duration that the executor should spend retrying before shutting itself down when it is disconnected from the agent (e.g., 15mins, 5secs etc.). This is configurable at agent startup via the flag --recovery_timeout.
MESOS_SUBSCRIPTION_BACKOFF_MAX: The maximum backoff duration to be used by the executor between two retries when disconnected (e.g., 250ms, 1mins etc.). This is configurable at agent startup via the flag --executor_reregistration_timeout.
