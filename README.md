werdlists
=========

Text files consisting of word lists, whitespace delimited row-based data, CSV
(Comma Separated Values) and similar data collections that are useful in
manually crafting software test cases or developing an automated black-box
fuzzer.

The 'scripts' folder consists of shell scripts used for maintenance and such. 
Other directories should be outlined in the index.lst file in the source root. 
Furthermore, all files in each directory are detailed in their own index.lst
files.  Although the majority of files have the ".txt" extension, pay attention
because other file extensions have meaning as well, such as ".csv" or comma-
separated values..
