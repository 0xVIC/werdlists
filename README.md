werdlists
=========

Text files consisting of word lists, whitespace delimited row-based data, CSV
(Comma Separated Values) and similar data collections that are useful in
manually crafting software test cases or developing an automated black-box
fuzzer.

The 'bin' folder consists of shell scripts used for maintenance and such. All
other directories should be outlined in the index.txt file in the source root.
