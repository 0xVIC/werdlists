MNP Operation

The V.FAST Class Modem supports all of the preceding classes. The following AT Commands apply to the MNP protocol:

Maximum MNP Block Size. Use this command to transmit smaller blocks of data in a reliable data link connection.

AT\A0          set maximum block size to 64 characters.
AT\A1          set maximum block size to 128 characters.  (default)
AT\A2          set maximum block size to 192 characters. 
AT\A3          set maximum block size to 256 characters.

Transmit Break. When this command is entered during a non-MNP connection, a break signal is sent to the remote modem.  The length of the break is 100 times the n parameter (1-9) in milliseconds. The default is 3.

AT\B3          (default)

Modem to Modem Flow Control. Enables or disables modem to modem flow control during a normal mode connection. This command is ignored when error correction is selected.

AT\G0          Disables flow control (XON/XOFF) (default)
AT\G1          Enables flow control (XON/XOFF)

Break Control. Determines the modem response when a BREAK is received from the DTE or the remote modem. The values of the parameters vary based on the three following conditions:

(1) When a break is received from the DTE during NORMAL or MNP mode:

AT\K0, 2, 4    modem enters command mode without sending a break to
               the remote modem.
AT\K1          modem clears the terminal and modem buffers and
               sends a break to the remote modem.
AT\K3          modem does not clear the buffers, but sends a break
               to the remote modem.
AT\K5          modem sends a break to the remote modem in sequence
               with any transmitted data.  (default)

(2) When a break is received from the remote modem during NORMAL
mode:

AT\K0, 1       modem clears the terminal and modem buffers and
               sends a break to the local DTE.
AT\K2, 3       modem does not clear the buffers but sends a break
               to the local DTE.
AT\K4, 5       modem sends a break in sequence with any data     
               being buffered. (default)

(3) When a break is received from the DTE during DIRECT MODE mode:

AT\K0,1,3      modem sends a break to the remote modem and enters
               command mode.

AT\K2, 4, 5    modem sends a break to the remote modem. (default)

 MNP Block Transfer Control. Determines whether or not the modem will use block or stream mode for MNP link.

AT\L0          uses stream mode for MNP link connections (default)
AT\L1          uses block mode for MNP connections

Error Correction Operating Mode. Selects the operating mode the modem uses while connected.

AT\N0          NORMAL (speed buffering) mode.
AT\N1          DIRECT (pass-through) mode.
AT\N2          RELIABLE LINK mode. Specifies error correction for
               the modem-to-modem connection 
AT\N3          AUTO-RELIABLE LINK mode. Attempts error-correction
               connection but will fall back to normal mode if
               unable to establish an MNP link. 
AT\N4          LAPM error correction mode.
AT\N5          MNP error correction mode

Split Speed Operation. Supports a split-speed DCE/DTE interface for applications which require a transmit speed of 75bps and receive speed of 1200bps at the DTE interface.

AT\W0          disables  (default)
AT\W1          enables

MNP Link Negotiation Speed. Controls the connection speed for link
negotiations.

AT*H0          link negotiation occurs at the highest supported  
               speed.  (default)
AT*H1          link negotiation occurs at 1200bps.


S-Registers 

This section defines the purpose of the modem registers, and sequentially lists the registers and describes their functions. These registers affect various operating characteristics and allow you to obtain information about the modem, as well as test the modem. Each register has a factory-set value, which you can read or change to fit your needs.

Reading a Register Value
To read the current value of a register, type:

AT Sn? [ENTER], 

where n is a register number. 

AT Sn? Sn? [ENTER] from the command mode. 

To read the register values of S0 and S1, type 

AT S0? S1? [ENTER]. 

The modem will display the first register value, a carriage return, the next register value, a carriage return, and OK or 0.

Changing a Register Value 
To change a register value, use the Sn command (ATSn=v), where n is a register number and v is the new value you want to assign to the register. Type:

AT S0=3 [ENTER] 

to have the modem automatically answer on the third ring.


The following table lists the modem's registers and their
functions:
