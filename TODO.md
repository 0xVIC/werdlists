Things To Do
============

* finish `scripts/extract-manpages-environ`
* make a script in `scripts/shared` to check if the CWD is scripts or repo root
* add list of scripts to `scripts/index.md`
* Make markdown tables in `telco-data/mobile-codes-notes.txt` like [List of Mobile Country or Geographical Area Codes](https://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-t/opb/sp/T-SP-E.212A-2017-PDF-E.pdf)
* Make markdown tables in `telco-data/country-codes-notes.txt` like [List of ITU-T Recommendation E.164 Assigned Country Codes](https://www.itu.int/itudoc/itu-t/ob-lists/icc/e164_763.pdf)
* write script to clean up which includes a `sort -u` of all `index.md` files
* split `code-keywords/ch-language-keywords.txt` into multiple files
* create a `werdlists` command to perform common utility functions like search
* rename every `index.lst` to `INDEX.md` so they can have markdown
* `sort -u` all `INDEX.md` files to ensure uniqueness and alphabetization
* delineate `opersys-strs/opsys-names-list` with newlines
* make `WRDLS_MDRDM` `until` code source'd from other scripts like `dirs-vs-index`
* write `files-vs-index` to check `index.lst` files in folders (webapp-data needs it.)
* make a syntax checker that bash -c's the scripts folder and checks indices?
* write C program for cleaning up regular wordlists
* write script/program for cleaning up CSV's and other file types for `scripts/bin`
* make extensions folder for to store stuff on each file name extension
* add `NetworkManager(8)` environment variable names to the full list
