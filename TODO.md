Things To Do
============

* write script to clean up which includes a `sort -u` of all `index.md` files
* split `code-keywords/chkeywords.txt` into multiple files
* create a `werdlists` command to perform common utility functions like search
* rename every `index.lst` to `INDEX.md` so they can have markdown
* `sort -u` all `INDEX.md` files to ensure uniqueness and alphabetization
* delineate `opersys-strs/opsys-names-list` with newlines
* make `WRDLS_MDRDM` `until` code source'd from other scripts like `dirs-vs-index`
* write `files-vs-index` to check `index.lst` files in folders (webapp-data needs it.)
* make a syntax checker that bash -c's the scripts folder and checks indices?
* write C program for cleaning up regular wordlists
* write script/program for cleaning up CSV's and other file types for `scripts/bin`
* make extensions folder for to store stuff on each file name extension
* add `NetworkManager(8)` environment variable names to the full list
