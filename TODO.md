Things To Do
============

* rename every `index.lst` to `INDEX.md` so they can have markdown
* `sort -u` all `INDEX.md` files to ensure uniqueness and alphabetization
* delineate `opersys-strs/opsys-names-list` with newlines
* make `WRDLS_MDRDM` `until` code source'd from other scripts like `dirs-vs-index`
* write `files-vs-index` to check `index.lst` files in folders (webapp-data needs it.)
* make a syntax checker that bash -c's the scripts folder and checks indices?
* find out why `./index.lst` are `./dns-domains/index.lst` are the same
* write C program for cleaning up regular wordlists
* write script/program for cleaning up CSV's and other types for `scripts/bin`
* make extensions folder to for each file name extension
* a file format should be associated with each extension: csv, txt, lst, etc.
* add NetworkManager(8) environment variable names to the full list
